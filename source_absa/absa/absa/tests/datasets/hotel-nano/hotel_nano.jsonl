{"review_id": 1816, "text": "We stayed here recently as part of our honeymoon trip and LOVED it.  \nFrom the minute we checked in to the minute we stepped out of the doors and into the airport shuttle again we had a brilliant time.\nIn particular Gloria in the club room lounge was a star \u2013 and really made sure we were having a great time.\nWe had a club room and were really pleased with it.  We had the option of upgrading when we checked in to have a better view/bathroom and we were really tempted but as the room had been a gift for our wedding we decided to see what we thought of the current room and we were really pleased with it.  The view wasn\u2019t quite as brilliant as other rooms would have been but we had the great view from the club lounge so decided to stick with the room.\nThe bathroom was great and the toiletries were elemis which was a lovely touch and meant we used them all \u2013 rather than them going to waste as some cheaper brands can.\nWe were really glad we got a club room as the breakfast was delicious and a great choice, and the afternoon tea/cocktails in the evening were fabulous.  It is by far the best club lounge I\u2019ve ever been to \u2013 we tend to frequent Hiltons, Hyatts and other similar chains so to see a more independent hotel with far superior service was refreshing.\nThe only two points of criticism I would have are breakfast service \u2013 not very good very haphazard, you had to ask for the menu and then get their attention to order, they often forgot your drinks and even your food.  One morning my husband and I placed the exact same order and my food came 25 mins after his (and several requests for it later!).  It didn\u2019t ruin our holiday at all but it is something that lets them down and if we\u2019d been in a rush we\u2019d have been annoyed.\nThe only other criticism is the cleanliness \u2013 which was generally great but the curtains in the bedroom were disgusting, something not very nice had clearly spilled down them a long time ago and had never been cleaned up. Yuk!\nOther than that we LOVED the hotel and would happily return.  They made sure we really got our honeymoon off to a great start \u2013 always referred to us as Mr&Mrs, we had a lovely bottle of bubbly and lovely note from them and they always asked how we were enjoying.  We were really sad to leave in the end and when we come back to Hong Kong we will definitely stay here again.\nLocation was great for us.  It is literally about 3 mins to the MTR and the same to a tram (and really easy too so you can\u2019t get lost).  It is a bit further out than other hotels which did worry us a little before we went but when we were there we were glad of this \u2013 it was a bit quieter and calmer where the hotel is which means you can stroll nearby markets, shops and restaurants with a bit more ease!\nWe got the airport express and then the airport express shuttle \u2013 it was so easy and I would highly recommend doing this \u2013 very quick and efficient and reasonable too.\nAll in all a great hotel and we look forward to returning.

{"review_id": 1819, "text": "We have just returned from a 12 day family holiday in Fiji.  Our first stop upon arrival was the Ourtigger on the Lagoon - we stayed for 5 nights in a Plantation Bure.  \n\nThe Bure was OK - just OK - nothing special and certainly not 5 star by any stretch of the imagination.  We had two Queen size beds which had lovely fresh sheets and were quite comfortable.  The bathroom was not in brilliant condition and in general, I would say that the room appeared a little tired and I would probably rate it at 3-4 stars by International standards.\n\nThe kids eat free deal was included in our accommodation but is really little more than a ruse to keep the adults eating in the resort at very steep prices.  Our kids aren't fussy eaters but by the end of four days, the constant diet of deep fried food (which was a complete novelty at the beginning) was starting to wear a little thin.  For adults, the meals offered were very mass produced American buffet style affairs - quantity won over quality every time - with the exception of the Indian night where I thought the curries were great.  If you order by the pool, make sure you order a LONG time before you expect to get hungry - drinks could take upwards of 30 minutes to arrive and meals 45 minutes.  The food delivery system is so poorly organised that the waiters wander around the pool looking for the person who had placed the order with the food rapidly going cold on their trays.  \n\nOur ten year old enjoyed the kids club - the six year old not so much - this may be due to the fact that the clubs are split into age groupings and the6 year old was in a group with kids aged from 3 - 7 and they did much safer quieter activities as they had such young ones in their group.\n\nThe reef outside the resort is 99% dead and very shallow.  The water is clear and very warm, but you can only swim, snorkel and kayak at high tide - that's only for about 2 hours each day.\n\nOverall, this was a safe, bland place to stay and we felt that as Australians,  if The Outrigger was the only place you were going to visit in Fiji, you might as well go to the Gold Coast.  I certainly wouldn't go back to that resort or probably any other on the Coral Coast - the Islands and more remote areas offer a true experience of another country and culture and The Outrigger offers only a bland, watered down 'sanitized' version.  \n\nThis is really mass tourism - and if that's what you're after, go for it!", "summary": "Definitely not 5 Star.

{"review_id": 1820, "text": "My husband (of 3 weeks) and I have just returned from a 9 day stay at the Outrigger Resort and I felt compelled to contribute my \"2 bob\" to this website as we consulted it regularly when making the decision of where to travel for our honeymoon.\n\nWe set out on our honeymoon bright eyed and excited about the experiences that lay ahead and generally speaking we are both pretty happy-go-lucky people. The reason I include this is that when I read through some of the negative, scathing reviews of the Outrigger, I find it impossible to comprehend that the people writing these reviews actually went to the same place that we did and can only put their experiences down to their personal attitudes and outlooks on things in general rather than an accurate reflection of the resort.\n\nWe arrived at the resort early one morning (approx 8.30am) after a sleepless overnight flight and were greeted by a 3 guitar serenade, cool water and ice tea, cool facewashers and many friendly faces- all saying 'bula!' We couldn't stop grinning to eachother as the warm atmosphere immediately made us feel welcome, happy and excited to see more!\n\nCheck in is not normally until 2 or 3pm but the front desk staff worked really hard to find us a bure as soon as possible (approx 10am) and in the meantime we were escorted to the buffet breakfast area to fill up on a delecious selection. I have read negative comments about the buffet breakfast including that it was stale, poor variety, old etc and would like to clarify that on the 3 separate times we had the full breakfast it was outstanding. The selection includes fresh fruit (cut in front of you), cereals, multiple juices, juice bar, tea and coffee, smoothie bar, yoghurt, all types of milk, poached fruit, pastries, scones, pancakes, baked beans, eggs (cooked any way you choose), bacon, ham, chipolatas, grilled tomoatoes etc.\n\nOur plantation bure was spacious, immaculately clean, cool, very quiet, very dark with all curtains closed allowing us to sleep during the first day, lovely shower, extremely comfortable king bed and pillows, phone, tv, couch, safe, table and chairs, and ample space to hang and store clothing. The bure felt safe and comfortable immediately and I would definitely recommend this to couples as it is very private and peaceful.\n\nI have read numerous complaints about the pool and would like to say that we found the pool to be flawless. I couldn't see any evidence of the bottom cracking away or needing maintenance and we never saw any \"floaties\". The pool is huge, very deep in places and very shallow in places, supervised, safe, good temperature and ample sun lounges.\n\nWe did not purchase the meal packages, nor did we eat every single meal at the resort but we did try every restaurant at least once including pizza, asian style food, seafood buffet, poolside snacks, cocktails and the Ivi restaurant. We did not have one negative experience. The prices are comparable- if not cheaper- to Australia and the food was all of a very high standard. Neither of us were at all unwell during our stay. We never experienced an unreasonable waiting time for any food or drink orders either.\n\nThe resort offers a multitude of activities including tennis and golf comps (we won a jet boat safari!), yoga, reef walks, water aerobics, free use of tennis and basketball courts and 24 hour fitness centre. We were never short of something to do, nor were we ever pressured to be involved in activites or distracted / annoyed by activities going on.\n\nThe only issue we experienced was that we were unable to get wireless internet in our bure due to the signal weakened by foliage. The IT manager liased with us and provided us with 2 days of free cable broadband whilst he rectified the problem- the issue (although very minor) was handled swiftly, efficiently and fairly. \n\nI could go on and on (even more) but I won't... I will just finish by saying that what really set this trip and this resort apart for us was the people. The staff were always extremely friendly, helpful, talkative, cheerful, laughing and could not do enough for us.

I'm talking jeans, jersey cold.

{"review_id": 1875, "text": "A mate booked this holiday for a group of us (lads trip), and after reading the reviews I was a bit worried. However, bear in mind this is a large chalet in a party town, and is not really aimed at young families etc. Having said that, it wasnt rowdy or noisy at any point.\nIts location is acceptable, being a short stiff walk into town (less than 5 minutes). The company lays on a mini bus that will take you down and back most days and the free navette bus drops you off at the bottom of the drive, so not really a problem. The chalet is clean and warm and reasonably comfortable. The beds were actually very comfortable (the best i've ever slept on while skiing). The living room and dining room are a bit cramped when everyone is in, but it is comfortable and warm, and has decent wifi. The hot tub is 'by the road', but it is hardly a road, more of a drive way, and has zero traffic to speak of. It is also shielded by a pile of snow (weather permitting) so it isnt a problem. They also change the water every week so you can be sure it is clean. The boot room was a little small, but worked fine and seemed to dry the boots fine. Plus the ski hire people dropped them off and collected them for you. \nThe staff were very friendly and polite, and never behaved anything other than professionally, so no complaint there. \nThe food and wine is probably the only low point(relatively speaking). The food was quite acceptable, sometimes good. The quantities were adequate, but if you are a hungry boy, it wont fill you up. One memorable night they burnt something badly and filled the building with smoke, and as a result, most of the  meal tasted like burning plastic, which wasnt great, but clearly just an accident - they were apologetic. (I think the food is centrally prepared and delivered meals on wheels style to be heated as a van would back up to the kitchen a few minutes before each meal). The wine they use is common to all ski total chalets and retails for less than a euro a bottle - make your own mind up about that! Breakfast was actually pretty good, as was the cake in the afternoon. \nIn summary, the chalet staff worked hard and gave us a good holiday experience. The skiing was good and it serves well as a base for the 3 valleys. I never felt let down at any point and enjoyed my week.

We took note of this and did not get charged any more.   It was just so modern, sparkling clean, and huge with a lovely modern open kitchen with everything one could want or need.  Then the dinning room area had a nice table with 6 chairs, which then flowed into the lounge area with sofas and chairs and a lovely coffee table and side table and lamp.  From the lounge area there were big glass windows looking out to the ocean - what a stunning view we had.  We also had a huge outside under cover verandah with a lovely table and chairs accommodating 6 people with ocean views.  There was a laundry cupboard with dryer and washing machine, ironing board etc  - very well fitted out.  Our bed room was stunning, very large with ocean views, and we had a spa bath which has slidinf doors into the bedroom so one could sit in the spa bath and see the ocean - rather unusual.  The bathroom had everyting one could want plus plenty of hanging and storage space.  I simply loved this apartment and would certainly stay again if the opportunity came up.

La Anita really is an ideal place to stay in Costa Rica.   \n\nUnlike some other places we visited, the food served was creative and varied from meal to meal and day to day. The cooks are fantastic and incorporate local and family recipes, using ingredients from the farm and the local area.  The hearts of palm ceviche was absolutely delicious. Cacao, grown on the farm, also finds its way into a variety of dishes, from the breakfast jam to dessert at dinner time. They also accommodated vegetarians easily at each meal.\n\nPablo and Ana are incredibly warm, welcoming and helpful. The cabins they built are charming and comfortable. Upon our arrival, Pablo noticed that the air in one of the tires on our rental car was low. He offered to have it checked out. Before we knew it, one of his staff had replaced the faulty air valve. I also got sick with some kind of stomach bug and was well cared for during our stay. They made sure we had what we needed and accommodated my dietary needs until I recovered.  Pablo visits with guests at most meals, and we learned a lot from him about Costa Rica during our chats.\n\nWe stayed for six nights and felt no reason to leave because La Anita is such a beautiful and relaxing setting.  We occupied our days with walks and bird watching. We also took advantage of the horseback and farm tours.  Both are recommended.

No restaurants, clubs, stores, etc.  I primarily chose TIL because I had heard the diving was better at Turneffe Atoll than off Ambergris Caye, and it was closer to the Blue Hole. This turned out, however, to be one of the most relaxing, enjoyable, and easy vacations I've ever been on. The lodge is simply beautiful. Rooms are spacious, made of beautiful mahogony, air conditioned (even though my ceiling fan was plenty), and all with a screened porch and a sensational view of the Carribean. There's a large beach (which is hard because it's coral) with plenty of lounge chairs and hammocks scattered throughout the resort. They also have a nice sized pool with a great deck and more sun and beach chairs. Meals are all eaten family style with the other guests (the entire resort max's out at just 38 guests) and the food is phenomenal (as well as Sherman the bartender). The large deck outside the dining room is great for hanging out with the other guests, smoking a cigar, having a drink, and listening to music, all while staring at the sea. Paddle boats, one and two man sea kayaks, and a small hobey cat awaits whoever wants them (at no extra charge) and there's even a nice little souvenier shop on premises. Oh, and NO PHONES OR TV's!!!! You have to take a 90 minute boat ride to get to the island which is  100% worth the wait (take dramamine for the boatride, though, as you will probably encounter semi-rocky waters along the way). You truly feel on vacation thanks to the warm hospitality of Uwe, Tonya, and the staff.\nThe TIL serves two major purposes: Fishing (bone and permit) and diving. Personally, I can only speak to the diving, which I'll say is great. Even though the vis was just okay two or three of the dives, we still saw healthy reefs thriving with gorgeous tropical fish. And the Dive Masters do just about everything.

{"review_id": 2029, "text": "2 families of 4 booked into the Tropicana rooms on New Years Eve travelling on a weeks package with Air Canada Vacations. I cannot recommend this room category for more than 2 people. The rooms are tiny, the bathroom is probably the smallest I have seen in any hotel. The safe was not working beacuse a company had not yet come to programme them. The balcony, although a decnet size, had no furniture and there are no chairs in the room. Because the room was so small we booked a condominum in the hotel complex (managed by an outside company) but decided to keep the hotel rooms so we could make use of the breakfast that was included with the package we had booked. \nAfter a couple of days I asked for something at the front desk of the hotel and my room number was requested. When I told her the number, I was not in the hotel system anywhere and neither were our friends. Our hotel rooms had been resold as the hotel was at capacity and a maid had said the rooms were empty. We had not checked out of the hotel or had any communication with the front desk. We had paid for 2 rooms for 7 nights. The hotel manager admitted they had sold our rooms and when we said that we should be given any proceeds from the room we were told that we would get none. I find this outrageous that you can register at a hotel and pre-pay for 7 nights and then have the room sold with no compensation or notification. We could easily have just been on a tour for couple of days and it is no business of the hotel as to whether we sleep in a room if we have paid for it. We had in fact gone back to the rooms to check for phone messages etc. \n If management had simply offered us an apology and perhaps some small compensation I would have been satisfied but instead they made our party upset and shrugged it off as not a problem and we would have to seek compensation in Canada..\nThe condos are of a high quality and in a great location by the lagoon pool and I would recommend booking one of these instead of with a dishonest hotel. The condos allow full use of all the hotel facilities.\nThe hotel itself is nice, definitely not 5 star but it doesn't claim to be either. For the size hotel it really should have some kind of fitness facility. Service at breakfast was good if you go before 8.30 but we noticed if you go after 9am that you cannot find silverware or a waiter.

The village is very picturesque, traditional old ski town a bit different to purpose built \"ski in/out\" places like Arc 1850 for example but very charming. Lots of lovely traditional restaurants to eat in (although do book first as don't seem to except walk in custom) we are intermediate level skiers and there is lots to keep you busy over the four massif areas. . From tree lined runs in manigod  to the more challenging reds & blacks in Balme. The four areas are also linked by runs & lifts dependent on your ski ability or for beginners there is a bus service. Don't let the low altitude put you off either as we had plenty of snow over the week just expect a little low cloud but does clear out. \n\nThe hotel (good parts) is in a evelvated position at the top of the town & location wise is perfect with a very short & flat walk to the bossonet lift and area over a foott bridge. We stayed in a studio appartment which was very small with pull out sofa bed but was nicely decorated with good quality fixtures & comfortable.

On arrival back st the hotel the reception was full with increasingly disgruntled guests waiting for keys. The staff on reception seemed to be struggling to manage & I think the only reason we got our keys st 6pm was because I kept going to the desk to ask. Once we finally made it to our block & room it had a slight unfinished feel and smelt of wet paint as if they had only just finished it s few hours before. Thet kitchen facilities were very small & limited with no actual oven so cooking was limited to very small hob or microwave.

{"review_id": 2052, "text": "Stayed 2 nights with a friend while we toured around KI. I had purchased a voucher for a 2 nights in a \"superior bayview\" room, with 20% off dinner one night in their restaurant and breakfast included, half price room rates.\nTo begin the room was neat and tidy, 2 single beds, small balcony basic TV, bathroom, tiny fridge (not even mini-fridge size). Would have been very unhappy to be paying full price (advertised $300 per night) as there was no room to spread out or relax apart from on the beds or on the tiny balcony.  No hairdryer in bathroom, no room service for meals either. Had dinner in the restaurant both nights as there are no other dining facilities in American River. Service and food was excellent however menu was very limited and to my surprise the \"locally Caught\" fish was almost the most expensive dish on the menu at over $30!

We stayed in a two room Ocean view suite, which was large enough and well air conditioned, but the room was tired and drab, the wifi was out for at least a day and one of the beach bar servers told me not to let my son dig in the sand ON THE BEACH because it was dirty. I didn't clarify what he meant by that and he didn't offer any additional explanation. This wasn't the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.

We had booked the superior room but on arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a Junior suite, it was bigger than any room i stayed in ever!! We had a lovely view of the waterfalls pool from our room and was in block 17, which was the block right next door to the lobby. \nWe had no problems getting sunbeds by the pool, we noticed people reserving their loungers at 7am, but we never got to the pool before 11am, and always got a lounger with a parasol. The staff are so friendly and happy, and a small tip to the waiters around the pool and lobby will see that you are never short of a drink. We went for a swim and as soon as we got out the pool there was the waiter with a drink for us! We also went to the beach a couple of times and again no problems with sun loungers, the Jetty is 1km and just walking up to the end its amazing how many fish you will see in such shallow waters (TIP - we found that we saw a lot more when going down there later in the afternoon.)\nThere was plenty to eat too with the main buffett restaurant and the 4 al a carte restaurants, Italian, Chinese, Mediterrean & Fish. We tried all of these most evenings, only actually eating in the main restaurant a few nights. Dinner in the main restaurant was very nice, and lots of choice with different theme nights every day so you would never get the same. Lunch was also nice with lots to choose from, we recommend the Pizza which is freshly made to order. The only thing we was not keen on was the breakfast as it got a little boring, but they do make nice omlettes. Our favourite A La Carte restaurant was the Italian, but they were all very nice, including the fish. I am not a huge fan of fish and was not too sure but i am glad we tried it as it was very nice and the staff were definitly the friendliest out of all the restaurants, I think they are pleased to see people as this was down on the beach and never really that busy, as i dont think fish is a lot of peoples ideal choice. \nTrips - Being our first time we booked our trips from the Rep (thomas Cook) but next time we will go outside the hotel and book as they are alot cheaper, if you haggle of course!! We did the adventure safari (Jeep & Camel rides in the desert and snorkelling in Dahub), this was a full day and definitly worth the money. We also did the Stargazing in the desert which included another camel ride, an experiance that must be done! And the sand buggies which was also excellant. We booked a submarine trip from United submarines who were in the hotel, and for about \u00a320 each was well worth it. Also we booked a snorkelling trip from the diving center on the beach, and this was again a full day and we went snorkelling in Ras Mohammend National Park, where we had 3 different stops and a buffett lunch on the boat which was also very nice and lots to eat. \nEntertainment in the evening was not too brilliant, they had shows on at the ampitheatre every evening which we watched a few, but otherwise we just either walked outside and did some shopping (The shopkeepers will try their hardest to get you in their shop but they are not at all agressive in anyway, we had lots of laughs with a few of them and haggled quite a bit!) Otherwise in the evening we would just sit in the air contioned lobby after dinner and have a few cocktails. \nOverall this hotel is by far the best we have stayed in and our first trip to Egypt was most definitly a successful one and will be returning.

To the point, though,  I was very impressed with La Villa Maillot.  It is a small hotel on a street about a block away from \nL' Avenue de Grande Armee which leads straight to the Arc de Triomphe,  and from there you walk on to the Champs Elysees.  The hotel room was immaculate and of a size that compares favorably to hotels in the USA.  The bed linens were sparkling white and luxurious as were the towels in the bathroom. The bathroom had all the necessities including a wall hair dryer that worked very well.  The bathtub included a hand held shower which I left in place because it worker very well as a regular shower head would.  The room had the customary coffee pot with coffee, tea and cream puches a traveler finds in USA hotels.  It also had a hospitality refrigerator which I did not use.  There are several small restaurants in the area, especially El Maestre, which served incredible Italian cuisine in a very small space.  \nThere is a 24/7 grocery store across the street for buying bread, cheese and things you may wish to have for a late snack in your room.  ATM was located a few feet from the hotel. \nAs for the hotel staff:  Patrick, the concierge, who has been with the hotel for over 15 years, is the most helpful person to know while at the hotel.  He arranged for my tours so that I could visit all the sites I wanted to see while in Paris.  He just picks up the phone and voila, the tour is set up for you.  The others at the front desk were equally friendly and helpful, but Patrick wins the medal de honneur.\nMy American Express tour included the \"Superior Buffet Breakfast\" and it was the best decision I made.  Every day,  I would visit the dining area which had the most comprehensive array of breakfast foods.  Even the scrambled eggs were just the way I like them. The waiters were very attentive to refill your coffee. \nI traveled alone, am an older person, and a neophyte to Paris, so I wanted to feel safe in the city.  I had nothing to worry about.  I was comfortable while there.  I recommend this hotel to all.  I saw just one family with children, though, so I do not know how well it fits into a family visit.

From my understanding the other Riu hotel next door had wifi included with your stay all over, and not just in the lobby area. Wifi was available for purchase, but it was actually more than what I pay for one month at my home, and this was for 1 day. You can purchase tours in the front lobbyfrom various services, which was convenient. The rooms were neat and almost the only air conditioned areas, but the resort is still comfortable. You won't spend a lot of time in the room,  so it served it's purpose. There is also a complementary bar with alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages in the room. If you never leave the resort, you won't have to spend a penny, or \"col\u00f2n\". The bartenders are great, even when they are trying to close i noticed they were still making drinks one night while it was pouring outside. Plus you get to see some exotic wildlife occasionally. I'm planning on returning in March for my birthday, but I may choose the Riu Palace next door, only because of the wifi situation and lack of being able to get phone service while on the property. Not that I want to be contacted, but I do want to be reached if need be.

We had a fifth floor room, which was great, but instead of rails that we could look through, we had walls. It was no big deal for us as we were not in our room very much, but if you want to sit in your deck chair and watch the ocean it was a bummer. The food was very good and the specialty restaurants were better. The Asian and Steakhouse were our favorites. The pool area was varied and quite large. The beach was not the best, kinda rocky and steep, but if you walk past the Palace beach, which is right next door, it was much better. The waves weren't bad unless it was very windy and the beach was gradual and sandy. About a quarter mile from the resort along the beach, you come to a sign that says Monkey Bar and Restaurant. Just up the dune is an area that has lots of monkeys and you can feed them. That was pretty cool. They don't like apples or pineapples though. Grapes and bananas. The bar was never open when we went, so I can't tell you about that. Our room was great and the service by the employees was exceptional. They were always ready to help you. Our water pressure was awesome, but some in our party had issues with the toilets. It is about a half hour from the airport and a close town called Coco Beach.

It was spotless and well appointed with a cool outdoor bathroom (and Pure Fiji toiletries).

There is snorkelling equipment, kayaks and SUPs to use for free.\n\nOur kids (6yo and 8yo) enjoyed Kids Club (although would come to find us sometimes!

I honestly meant to write this on the plane ride home, but for one reason or another, it got put on the back-burner. I still think about my week at the wonderful Playa Guiones and with the wonderful staff and people at Surf Simply. \n\nI came here to really break through the wall of frustration that I developed over four and half years of self taught surfing. During the week I was lucky enough to work with Will and Harry, who both did a wonderful job of helping me reflect on my practice and set goals for it as well. \n\nThroughout the week, I kept a journal of everything, and here's what I wrote on day one: \"This was my first real surf lesson at surf simply, and honestly, I learned more in 90 minutes of Will\u2019s instruction than I have in the five years that I\u2019ve been \u201csurfing.\u201d (I put surfing in air quotes because until this morning, what I\u2019ve been doing was not surfing.) For this session, we basically start out surfing white water waves. (Note: don\u2019t dismiss white water sessions anymore. They are a great place to drill certain skills.) I was catching the white water and popping up fine, but I didn\u2019t really move along the wave.\" If you feel like you've hit a wall and don't know what to do, this is THE place for you.

It was clean and everything worked. Probably the best part of this hotel was the location. The entrance to the metro (M 10 I believe) is across the street. This will take you to the Notre Dame area. It is a quick 15 minute ride from your stop.  The bus #42, which takes you to the Eiffel Tower I believe is on the same street as the hotel. However, I don\u2019t remember if it is going away from the tower or towards. Nevertheless, if it is going away from the tower, the stop going towards the tower should be around there as well (obviously). A few other essentials that one might need/want, there is a Starbucks and a pharmacy across the street, there are a few grocery stores on this street and around the area. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and a really good bakery/pastry shop on the same block but around the corner. \n\nThe hotel does provide free internet. Being that I was on the first floor, I had no problem with internet connection; however, the other couple we were traveling with (they were on the 6th floor) said they weren't able to connect. \n\nThere is one BAD CON that I MUST report: two days in a row, the cleaning staff came into our room even though we had placed the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d placard on our door.

{"review_id": 2686, "text": "Disclaimer: \n\nI've become very picky when I travel. Cleanliness, maintenance & upkeep, employee attitudes, hell even employee uniforms, they all fail to escape my scrutiny when I travel these days. I'm not always nasty, really. I believe in objectivity whenever casting a (critical) eye. So with that in mind, for those optimists amongst you reading this, those happy folk who detest all and any forms of negativity, stop reading now! This isn't going to be pretty.....\n\nWhy? \n\nIt's simple. \n\nBecause this property is appalling! \n\nI enjoy visiting canberra most because it's cleanliness and sense of order in urban design and planning contrasts so beautifully against Sydney's grunge, Melbournes anal retentive chic, Adelaide's stiflingly conservative, and perths..... well, perthyness! \n\nNorthbourne Ave is a simple yet very effective strip of private apartment accomodation, hotels, and most appropriately for me, serviced apartments. When serviced apartments \u2018work\u2019 well they are my home away from home. True I rarely use the kitchen to cook in, the dining room table to dine on, or even hang clothes in the closet to any great extent (don't judge me) but they are there if I need them, just like they are at home. \n\nServiced apartments make me feel normal, or as close to it as I will ever be. They don't have to be perfect, after all we all arrange our homes to suit our own tastes. But!! But they must adhere to some basic principles. Let me list what I believe to be the fundamentals, in light of what I was faced with during my stay....\n\n- Clean walls, free from (at least most) hand prints, suitcase scuffs, and holes (yes holes!);\n\n- Properly painted walls, with any holes or chips filled in.

When we arrived, check in was busy and it wasn't a short or easy process (I had to sign multiple different forms) \n\nAfter pulling a suitcase all the way from the train station, all i wanted to do was lay in bed. When opening the door to our apartment, there was a green bag full of dirty laundry at our feet. Slightly confused we placed our luggage inside to see if anything else was wrong. The room had an odd feeling to it like a guest had just left. To our surprise all kitchen cupboards were left open, as well as the dishwasher. The bath/shower combo was full of mould and on the door to the second bedroom was a sign saying we had to pay extra to use the room ?\n\nI told my Mum about the issue as she wanted everything to be perfect. Then i rang reception and they told me they will send someone up to collect the dirty laundry - that's it ! I'm a bit of a push-over and didn't want to be a hassle. My Mum however (who paid for the accommodation as a gift), was not happy. Reception ended up upgrading us to a higher floor in a cleaner apartment. Keep in mind we had to drag our luggage all the way back down to reception and back up again.\n\nThe new apartment was perfect, however the second bedroom had the same sign on the door and was also locked. Which was fine because they weren't expecting us to be in that room. Someone unlocked the door straight away and all was forgiven.\n\nAfter hoping that was the last of our issues, that night we wanted to watch some TV. The TV itself was a smart TV and very hard to navigate. We tried to change it to Foxtel but it didn't pick up a signal. We called reception again and they put Foxtel on and left. While scrolling through channels, we realised the Foxtel in fact did not work. It said the hotel needed to update their membership.\n\nVery frustrated, my friends and I gave up and couldn't be bothered calling reception AGAIN.

It is a very simple journey if arriving at the Gare dU Nord, by taking the metro to the Republique and changing for Gambetta.\nThere are also buses opposite the Metro (69), which went into the center of Paris, although we always used the Metro.\nWe dined twice at the restaurant opposite the Metro ( I think it was Cafe Martin) and had some very good food. Between my husband and myself, we tried the Cheeseburger (pure beef), L-bone steak, Sea Bass and three-slamon dish (unusual and delicious). \nThe hotel is very reasonably priced, no doubt because it had no dining area or lounge, (although it did offer free Wi-Fi), but for me it could not have been more perfect and we shall definitely return.\nMany thanks to all at the Nadaud Hotel.", "summary": "I want to really keep this a secret!", "session_uuid": "42da563f-5e21-4ade-83e1-9c7eb2079ad8", "rating": 5, "context": {"item": "Nadaud Hotel", "session_type": "TRUTH"}, "segments": [{"text": "The bed was comfortable and the bedroom, toilet and bathroom, were meticulously clean.", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "NONE"], ["Cleanliness", "POS"]]}, {"text": "There was everything we needed, e.g. toiletries, hairdryer, etc.", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "POS"], ["Staff", "NONE"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}, {"text": "Throughout our stay, every member of staff was very friendly and always checked that everything was to our satisfaction.\n", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "POS"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}]}

Both machines were modern and worked well.\n\nThe spacious open plan Kitchenette and Lounge gave the apartment a light and airy feel. The kitchenette was a good size and the layout was very good. There was a large stainless Fridge / Freezer, a built in oven with a halogen hob and a microwave. There was a \"marble\" breakfast counter with a couple of bar stools\n\nUnfortunately the lounge area was let down by having a couple of 2-seater sofas which were in dire need of a good clean. Upholstered in beige microfibre fabric there were stains on the cushions and the arms were almost black with grease and dirt. Likewise, the many throw cushions smelt \"old\" and the \"white\" shag pile rug under the coffee table was a dirty grey and had a couple of big stains on it. Because the view from the large picture window was so good we kept the net curtains open at all times, but they also were grey with grime. \n\nAside from the soft furnishings, the apartment presented as clean and fresh. Housekeeping appear to do a good job. \n\nStaff at reception were helpful and friendly.", "summary": "Hadn't been sure what to expect . . .", "session_uuid": "42da563f-5e21-4ade-83e1-9c7eb2079ad8", "rating": 3, "context": {"item": "Oaks Goldsbrough Apartments", "session_type": "TRUTH"}, "segments": [{"text": "In the event the staff were very kind", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "POS"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}, {"text": "There was a large stainless Fridge / Freezer, a built in oven with a halogen hob and a microwave.", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "POS"], ["Staff", "NONE"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}, {"text": "Unfortunately the lounge area was let down by having a couple of 2-seater sofas which were in dire need of a good clean.", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "NONE"], ["Cleanliness", "NEG"]]}, {"text": "Upholstered in beige microfibre fabric there were stains on the cushions and the arms were almost black with grease and dirt.", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "NONE"], ["Cleanliness", "NEG"]]}, {"text": "Likewise, the many throw cushions smelt \"old\" and the \"white\" shag pile rug under the coffee table was a dirty grey and had a couple of big stains on it.", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "NONE"], ["Cleanliness", "NEG"]]}, {"text": "Aside from the soft furnishings, the apartment presented as clean and fresh.", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "NONE"], ["Cleanliness", "POS"]]}, {"text": "Housekeeping appear to do a good job. \n\n", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "POS"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}]}

{"review_id": 2792, "text": "PRIVILEGED LOCATION FOR DIRECT CUSTOMERS\n\nClearly the privileged view is towards the beach of Quatro Ilhas, and is the one that is seen mainly in the photos. Unfortunately, we booked for 10 nights through booking.com several months in advance and we were located on the Bombinhas side and also on the lower floor, with a view of the street and a little of the sea, which is nice, but it hurts because we were excited about the other side. So, we asked to be relocated and they agreed, but on the ground floor... obviously we did not have the same priority as other customers.\n\nTWO POUSADAS IN ONE\n\nPousada 1: the \"mini\" suites\n\nThey are offered as \"suites with ocean view\": they are 32 rooms distributed in 4 very new constructions (they are still finishing some parts), very tight, with no green spaces between them. Beware because they are very small: if they accommodate more than 2 adults, those who occupy the tiny sofa bed have to be of very short stature or choose to sleep contorted and get up with neck pain. What I did not like is that the owners publish the suites as apt for up to 4 adults, when in fact they are rooms where no more than two adults are comfortable (or 2 adults and 2 childs). For this reason we had to relocate to a bungalow, which is almost like changing of pousada.\nAlso, I was struck by the fact that there are almost no photos of the exterior of these suites on Internet, where you could appreciate their less attractive appearance (compared to bungalows), e.g. the exterior corridors do not have the characteristic brick and wood floor, but a seemingly unfinished smoothed cement.\n\nPousada 2: the original Arvoredo Pousada\n\nThey are the imposing bungalows or cabins of older construction with picturesque thatched roof and rustic style, that give the distinctive touch to the inn. These don't have the problem of lack of space of the mini-suites, because in addition to being more spacious, some have separate rooms and living room. But it is logical that they do not pay off the same to investors because they are less units and are more separated with garden among them. Against them: we had to stay in one of the older ones, which lacks some maintenance, and the double bed is very small.\n\nROUGH MANNERS\n\nIn general the innkeepers are very friendly, but unfortunately a clerk at the front desk treated us clumsily the second day of our stay, complaining about us having delayed 15% payment we had to pay, and reminding us by shouting from the front door when we went up the stairs to the room.\n\nBREAKFAST\n\nFor what one expects from Brazil, the breakfast offered by the inn is \"regular\". The coffee, according to the day, came watery or stronger. The tables very close together are a problem at \"peak time\". A single toaster for the whole inn is very little. The napkin holders should be on the tables, not the coffee bar (we always remembered that they were missing when we were already served and seated). Regular fruit juices. I think that compared to other inns and the price that Arvoredo charges, the level should be improved.", "summary": "Very small suites; be careful of old photographs", "session_uuid": "42da563f-5e21-4ade-83e1-9c7eb2079ad8", "rating": 2, "context": {"item": "Pousada do Arvoredo", "session_type": "TRUTH"}, "segments": [{"text": "A single toaster for the whole inn is very little.", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NEG"], ["Staff", "NONE"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}]}

Charlie Rockets was a great option, right downtown, walking distance to everything.  The bar on the main floor of the hostel is always bumping, great to meet people!  The bar stays open until 4 or 5 am!  I think even 6am once!  The food at the bar is great, it comes from the adjacent italian pizza place next door.  The check-in is slightly odd, because they really don't have a front desk, you to go a tiny side desk by the bar where you check-in and are given the keys.  If you have to wait a few minutes, who cares!  Its a hostel, not a 5 star hotel.  The staff at the desk are also serving your beers, and food, so they help with everything.  Good people!  We got alot of local advice from them, and they partied with us late night.  \n\nWe booked a private room, so I can't comment on the security of a shared room.  But the private room was plenty of space, 2 cots with hard uncomfortable matresses, but who cares, we weren't there for cozy living.  The private room had a sink in the room, so we could brush our teeth.  The toilets and showers were shared in the hallways.  The toilets were pretty dirty, but that didn't bother me.  What sucked was taking a cold shower since hot water wasn't working, but oh well, I didn't expect much at a hostel.  The most important things you need at a hostel (safety, security, and fun) were all there, so that's enough for me!  It was weird to give the key back to the staff every time we leave or arrive, but we got used to it, and there was no issues.  There's no curfew, so that's totally great.  The people we met at the downstairs bar were a lot of fun. \n\nI would totally stay here again if traveling on a budget.  The beds sucked (hard mattresses, but at least they're clean!), but the staff were great, the private rooms had a sink, more than enough space for 2 friends traveling together.  The bar was huge, open late night/mornings, and a great way to meet new friends.  Perfect for young adults on a budget, who spend more time partying than sleeping.   \n\nOh, free wi-fi only works in the bar/lobby, not in your room.

Its currently $130 on wotif, and that is a much more reasonable price. \n\nRoom was spacious and beautifully furnished. But we arrived in Friday afternoon approx. 8 degrees in Mittagong, the heater was on but it is placed directly below an OPEN window, so it was freezing! We indadvertantly turned the heater off again on Saturday (there is no sign for which way is on/off) so again got home on Saturday afternoon and it was freezing. We literally had to jump into bed to keep warm. I went down to reception later in the night to ask for another blanket, but reception closes at 8pm on a Saturday so there was nothing we could do except hope and wait for the heater to warm the room (I ended up sleeping in socks and heavy PJ's to get through). \n\nThe bathroom is so old and shabby, looks installed in the late 80's- faucet cupboard had water issues, rust on the heater, old murky tiles and a full length curtain for a half-length window that just draped to one side of the toilet which is just lazy furnishing. I assume renovations will eventually get to the bathrooms, but this is really below standard for the price. \n\nWe stayed in room 2 and the door to the room is obviously new as it's just an unfinished piece of wood (with no safety lock). The edging on the door frame had not been finished yet and as there are two very bright chandeliers right outside on the landing, the light streamed through all evening. They will be best to get a builder to build a proper frame for the door so as to cover this, as we ended up having to drape towels over the coat rack and a pillow over the gap to try and alleviate some of the light. \n\nThis room is also directly above the main door to the hotel, as we were back in our hotel early (around 8pm) every time a guest left the restaurant for the next 3 hours, we heard the swing/slam of the front door. \n\nSo whilst this room is lovely in the morning to get the early sun, we didn't get to sleep until after the door stopped rumbling beneath us. \n\nThey do complimentary drinks service in the lounge from 4-6pm. But for a hotel with so many rooms, they really need to have another place for this to occur. We got there and every single chair was taken, we sat at the bar until a table cleared, but about 10 people came in after us and just left as nowhere to sit. On the Saturday night, we went to the lounge again around 8.30pm, but there was no bar service and no atmosphere - they turn the music off and there are no board games or magazines/book cupboard (small things that will help with guest relations). \n\nThe onsite restaurant looked nice but it really expensive, and there is no room service as far as we know.

Also close to Saint Augustine metro which was handy getting to some areas. Suggest you buy a Paris Pass which includes unlimited travel including Versailles and the airport (you buy it in 3 or 5 day lots). \n\n-Major shopping district within 5 minutes and a supermarket 2 mins walk away. Laundromat and gym close too (10 min walk). \n\n-Great bed in the Balcony Superior Double room. Huge and comfortable.  \n\n-All the front of house staff speak English and are quick to offer help and advice. \n\n-The area is quiet at night which I liked but not ideal if you want to get to bars/clubs quickly. Not sure where the \"sound proof\" claims come from - I definitely heard fellow guests and staff. \n\n-Great WIFI. \n\n-Although very compact, the rooms are nicely decorated. \n\nCONs\n\n-Not a lot of food in the immediate vicinity, but I was happy to grab a quick train or walk. \n\n-The hotel has a very odd demand of its guest - you need to hand over your keys when you leave and they give them back when you return. I was quite annoyed by this custom to begin with (it was like reporting to mum every night!) but I relaxed as I got to know the staff. Still - I would prefer just to have a swipe card. \n\n-The rooms are extremely small - think NYC size hotel. I had to lie my suitcase on the floor in between the bed and balcony as there was no other floor space.\n\n- I would not suggest you bother paying for a balcony room unless you definitely have secured the single room on the corner that has the view of the Eiffel Tower (which is the pics they use in the marketing material and on Trip Advisor). The balcony room I got was nice but no real view, and no real street action to people watch, so in hindsight there was no point to it. \n\n-The breakfast is good and lots to choose from but may seem light on for Americans / Australians / English (eg boil your own eggs, no bacon). \n\n-Terrible shower. Would run hot and cold all the time and had hardly any water pressure.

A few small tips probably mean a lot more to the Egyptian staff than they mean to me, and are well deserved. The guy who cleaned our room was great and couldnt do enough for us!\nThe rooms: We had a sea view jacuzzi room and it was excellent. Very clean, large, great bathroom and huge comfy bed. Sun loungers on the balcony would have been nice tho chairs were provided.\nThe resort: Very clean, huge numbers of friendly staff and a good selection of places to eat.\nYeah there were some difficulties booking the a la carte restaurants but we had no trouble getting tables later in the evening whenever we tried. The food was good. Remember this is the middle of the desert not central London, so be open minded as the ingredients are sometimes slightly different.

The fountain view buffet restaurant has a huge choice for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I find it quite astounding that people say they couldnt find something they liked. There were quite a lot of local dishes to choose from and they were all very nice too.\nThe beer and wine included were decent enough and I dont like nasty wine. Some of the spirits with mixers, and cocktails varied but any mention of them not being 'quite right' and they were quickly whisked away and replaced by the excellent staff.\nThere is snorkelling off the jetty which is very good, watersports and trips available on the beach.\nThe spa was very good and they have lots of special offers worth checking out. We had a package of massage, facial and foot massage and it was approx \u00a3100 for 2 and well worth it. You can use the indoor pool, sauna and wicked steam room if you book a treatment so go in before your treatment.\nRegarding sun loungers on the beach or by the pool. If you're not up early then you should have no problem getting one around 12ish in the heat of the day or a little later in the afternoon too.

It's comfortable enough, and basically you get to enjoy modern amenities in faux local culture.\n\nService was almost non-existent -- porters expect a huge tip and if you don't want to pay, you will have to lug your own luggage to the room itself. I don't think there's a restaurant at this hotel, as breakfast is at a small, Tibetan-owned cafe-like outlet opposite its main entrance. Housewkeeping was adequate and really, there is nothing too much to shout about for this hotel, except that the location gives you the option of dropping your shopping bags in the middle of your shopping, and then continue to shop after that.\n\nOne thing to note is that cars are not allowed inside the old town of Lijiang, so you'd have to pull your luggage all the way down the cobble-stoned alleys to the hotel. Lijiang is also known for its bars and nightlife, so in the middle of the night, don't be surprised if you're awoken by the banging of drums and the rock music not too far away. \n\nThat said, I still like this hotel and for the low price they charge, I think it's worth its penny. Try it but don't expect too much and you should be happy, like me, in Lijiang.", "summary": "Come to Lijiang for its beauty, but stay at Sanhe without high expectations & you should be happy", "session_uuid": "42da563f-5e21-4ade-83e1-9c7eb2079ad8", "rating": 3, "context": {"item": "Lijiang Sanhe Hotel", "session_type": "TRUTH"}, "segments": [{"text": "It's comfortable enough, and basically you get to enjoy modern amenities in faux local culture.\n\n", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "POS"], ["Staff", "NONE"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}, {"text": "Service was almost non-existent -- porters expect a huge tip and if you don't want to pay, you will have to lug your own luggage to the room itself.", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "NEG"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}, {"text": "Housewkeeping was adequate and really, there is nothing too much to shout about for this hotel, except that the location gives you the option of dropping your shopping bags in the middle of your shopping, and then continue to shop after that.\n\n", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "NEU"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}]}

A great bar with a cool atmosphere, free WiFi and Mutzig on draught + SKY sports if its your bag.?\nFor Snowsporters (if that's a word?), there is a warm outhouse for boots/skis/boards etc. with access 24/7 on a coded lock system that seems to work pretty well. Now for the negatives, Rooms..No remote control, petty I guess but frustrating all the same. No TCMF in the rooms (tea and coffee making facilities). Towels not changed all week even when left in the bottom of the shower, we resorted to raiding the linen cupboards situated on each floor (top tip!). Poor cleanliness in the rooms throughout the stay, a room service seems to be simply making the beds, nothing more nothing less. Shower gel/shampoo not replemished thoughout the stay, not a biggy but it really wouldn't hurt. We had room No. 9 (a cheap one), this was very small as expected and have no issue with that but beware when booking, remember, you get what you pay for! There was a large burn on the wardrobe - not sure how this had happened but just leaving it is not acceptable. No heated handrails in the rooms - a must for a Winter Ski trip. Small Bedrooms have storage issues by definition so more coat hangers would have been helpful.

Dixies bar next door is a fine venue for late night entertainment but has it's drawbacks when an early night is needed after a full days ski, please consider this as we had a couple of difficult sleeps. The food was very good in quality but not so fabulous in choice, Breakfast was the biggest issue for us as bread/Croissant/Butter/Jam/Pain Au Choc/Cereal/Juice/Tea/Coffee on offer is quite simply not a good enough selection. All it would have taken would have been some boiled eggs, ham, cheese (this is France you know!) and a few pots of yoghurt to keep all residents happy. Dinner was also very good in quailty but no choices other than 1 starter, 1 main, 1 pud. Moan over and having said all that we would go back.

The owners, Mick & Sally Byrne, are ex- Patriot Brits that certainly know how to make one feel at home, with friendly and convivial company, and excellent accommodations and meals.\n\nAll the rooms are very clean, and tastefully decorated, with emphasis on comfort and privacy. Our room was very warm and comfortable,(we were there for 3 days in early February), the bathroom was new and well appointed. The village of St.Louet sur Vire, where \u201cLa Thiaumerie\u201d, is situated, is so picturesque and bucolic, you can imagine you have been transported back in time to a simpler, more romantic time, and the intrusions of the modern world are held at bay, as if by the magic of the setting. We traveled to the D-Day beaches, and to Bayeux, to see the tapestries, and were impressed with the views of the countryside, and villages that we passed through. We also made a trip to the offshore Monastery at Mont St. Michel, which is stupendous, not far from \u201cLa Thiaumerie\u201d, and on the border of Normandy and Brittany. If you have made the trip to Mont St. Michel, you must go a little further down the coast to Cancale, Brittany, the oyster capital of France!\n\nAll in all, \u201cLa Thiaumerie\u201d, is ideally situated for that romantic getaway, or to use as a base for travels, through the Normandy historical sites. Mick & Sally are the most accommodating hosts, who are very knowledgeable of the local area and sights. Make sure to avail yourself of the excellent meal plan as offered by Mick & Sally. Sally\u2019s culinary skills are quite extraordinary, and the fare is always first class with a local leaning. The cheese board is FANTASTIC!!!

They have a group of such young, talented, energetic staff that work very hard every day to present a great show.  They would have entertainment for the kids on stage from 8-8:30 PM, and then do an audience ice-breaker afterwards, which  was always clever and fun.  The shows started at 9.  The night they did Michael Jackson was excellent!  As far as excursions, be sure to contact Alex on the Beach!!  We made a trip to Palo Verde, and because we were the only ones signed up for that day, we had a private trip!  Alex made several stops along the way to show us the culture and history of Costa Rica (this was not actually part of the trip).  We were then on the river boat by ourselves with him.  It was an amazing day.  He does an excellent job and a bit less expensive than the hotel trips.  We were very pleased.  He let us know, that if you sign up for a trip, they will take you regardless the size of the group (we only had the 2 of us).  He is also very willing to create a trip for you or your group.

The swimming pools were very nice and always enjoy having a swim up bar!  The food was your typical resort food but no complaints.  We thought the Asian restaurant and the Steak House were the best.  The food at the Italian restaurant was not bad but the service was very poor.  We really enjoyed the Grease, Disco and Michael Jackson shows but the others were just okay to boring.  The staff was very professional and friendly but did not feel that the entertainment team mingled with the people like a lot of the Riu's I have stayed at in the past.  If you are seeing pictures of lobster and steak, that is at the Riu Palace only.  You will not find lobster at this resort.  If you walk down the beach to the left when facing the water, you will come to a white sign that says Monkey Bar and points into the woods.  Take the time to make the short walk there and have a beer with the bar owner.  We walked down several times and enjoyed some chips ans salsa and beer.  They sell several different food and alcohol items and their prices are very reasonable.  It is a fun experience and the locals in Costa Rica are awesome.  The sand is black from the volcano and the water appears to be dark because of the black sand.  The water was actually clear once you got out in it but always lots of waves.  If you are looking for clear, blue, calm water, this is not the place for you.  I am used to the white sand with clear blue water, however, I am glad we went and definitely enjoyed every minute.  My most favorite day was our excursion to Vandara Hot Springs.  This trip included horseback riding up the mountain and zip lining back down, a wild water slide, an organic lunch and sampling their homemade moonshine.  I would highly recommend booking through the Nexus rep sitting in the lobby named Gilbert.  He will give you the best deal!  Most of all, if you do not request Martin Blanco as your tour guide you are missing out on an experience of a lifetime!  He made our day so special and I feel truly blessed to have had the opportunity to meet and spend a day with this young man.  Words can not describe what a great job he did making this day special for everyone in our group regardless of their age and physical abilities.

The bathroom has a separate bath and shower with his and her sinks which makes this very convenient. Large TV with some decent English channels. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Room attended to every day and given fresh towels every day. Was disappointed as had no towel art this year and left a tip quite a few times.  \nThe pool areas are great. Large comfy sun loungers with large clean swimming pools. Around the pools is nice and relaxing and quiet, no one trying to sell you anything or asking you to get involved in any entertainment. There is a pool attendant on hand who is a gem, helps you to set you the umbrellas and comes round once a day providing a cold face towels to freshen up. There is a bar close to the pools which you get all your drinks and snacks from. \nThe food was lovely, even if you are a fussy eater there is something there for anyone. If you are in the le royale you get to use the la gondala restaurant so your not in the maniac of the other restaurants used by the sonesta beach guests.\nThe beach is quite small and gets very busy, le royale guests get a separate part of the beach to lay on the sun beds but the area of the sea used is used by all guests and does get very busy and cramped quickly. The sea is however beautiful and plenty of fish to see if snorkelling. \nThe staff are an absolute gem at this hotel, always working hard, doing the best they can for you.

{"review_id": 918, "text": "We recently spent 5 nights in this hotel, which is in a great location.  The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated but extremely small but I guess that is to be expected in Paris.  In both rooms we had there was hardly any clothes storage and we had to stack our suitcases on top of each other as there was no where else to put them.  Some of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, while others  were the opposite!  We were given the wrong time for the breakfast finishing time by one of the reception staff so arrived one morning ten minutes before breakfast service finished.  There was very little food left so when we asked for more, we were told 'no, breakfast service has nearly finished, we will not be putting any more food out.'  Extremely unprofessional considering that we had been given the wrong information by another staff memeber (I think they have longer breakfast hours on the weekend compared to during the week but we were not told this when we checked in).  The air conditioning stopped working after a few nights and unfortunately could not be fixed, which was rather uncomfortable as it was mid summer.  In fairness, we were given a discount on the 2 nights we had no air con and were told we could help ourselves to the mini bar, which was appreciated, but at that time of year, air con is a must!  The most disappointing part of our stay came about after my 11 year old son was involved in an accident by the River Seine and taken to a Parisian hospital with severe concussion.  His condition improved and he was released and we went back to the Hotel so he could rest as we were leaving to travel home the next day on a 17 hour flight.  The reception staff that night ( a young man) was very kind and showed concern for my son as his face was covered in grazes and bruises.  The next day our flight was not until 6pm and check out was at 12pm.  I explained the situation to the morning reception staff about my son being in hospital and asked if there was any chance of a late check out (which I was prepared to pay for).  He was still very weak and needed to rest so we could not really go anywhere, like we had planned to do.  The receptionist said the hotel was almost fully booked and my only option was to move rooms and pay a full night, which I chose not to do as we only needed it for a couple of hours.   I then asked if it was possible to be the last room cleaned so that my son could rest a little longer (surely every room is not cleaned at 12pm on the dot?)  The answer was 'no.'  We planned to check out at 12pm but received a call at approximately 11.50 telling us it was time to vacate the room!  I know they have a hotel to run but a lot can be said for showing a bit of empathy and kindness! Depending on which staff member you got, the level of service differed greatly.  Some of the staff were lovely (including the young French girl on reception with brown hair and glasses) but there were others who could do with more customer service training.

{"review_id": 963, "text": "Where to start?  The holiday started badly to say the least.  The Holiday Village was not ready to open when we arrived on the 14th June due to a problem with the fire alarm system so we were placed in the Conrad Hotel for 2 nights.  We were promised we would be in the Holiday Village on the 16th June and sure enough we arrived at the HV at the time promised (see forum comments with regards to this).\nSo the HV...it\u2019s brand new and we were the first people to stay in our room.  We had a swim up room.  The room was massive and we had our own private balcony and sun loungers (x2) and direct access to the pool (which is only for use of other swim up guests).  The room was lovely, with a massive bed, walk-in wardrobe, walk in shower with rain shower head and a large bathroom.  The first thing that I noticed was the room was quite dark, the lighting was poor throughout but this was not a major problem.  The room also looked quite rushed with the finishing, the surfaces and floors were quite dusty and there were paint splatters on the floor and tiling adhesive was left a little untidy.  The light in out toilet room and outside light failed to work after 2 days, we reported this 3 or 4 times but it was never fixed during our stay!\nIt was safe to say that there was more staff than guests during our stay. Building work was still continuing over half of the hotel so there were contractors and gardeners everywhere but the work was confined to the rear of the property and you couldn't see or hear it from the parts that were finished apart from the occasional hammer or drill.  The actual HV staff was very good and there were reps everywhere, they were all under massive amounts of pressure to get the place ready and keep people happy, as many people were complaining about various things, but the staff always said hello and always smiled.\nThe food was OK, they are still learning about British tastes and they were trying new things everyday.  Breakfast was basic, no proper sausage and no bacon, but this was expected but they did have chefs making fresh omelettes and fried eggs.  Lunch and dinner was basically different types of chicken, beef, potatoes and rice.  There was also a pasta station where it was made fresh in front of you but there was only tomato and carbanara sauce to choose from. Puddings were just cake, cake and more cake\u2026no ice cream!!!\nIn the evening there were a few bars to choose from, we didn\u2019t get involved in the Butlins style entertainment down at the pool bar but I did notice there wasn\u2019t enough seating there so you had to sit on sun loungers if you didn\u2019t want to sit in the \u201camphitheatre\u201d (where the entertainment was staged).  There was also the lobby bar, which was good if you wanted to listen in to all the complaints being made. The Sports Bar, which had an ice rink slippery floor, this was full of big screens for sport and very loud music and was frequented by children and there drunk parents letting them slide on the floor and also falling over and making fools of themselves as well!  We preferred The View Bar.  No children allowed in here\u2026hooray!  It was very quiet in there and had a lovely roof terrace with sofas and candle lit tables, inside was very contemporary and cool and the drinks were all served to your table by the bar staff, who were excellent.\nMuch of the facilities where not open as promised, like the pirate ship for the kids and the beach bar, there was also no shop ready but makeshift stalls were laid out for things like cameras and batteries there was also a small selection of tack and some cigarettes but no multi-packs.  Any facilities that were not ready had to be utilized in the sister hotel, The Coral Sea which was about a 10 minute walk up the beach path\u2026not really ideal.\nIn conclusion, we enjoyed our stay but we were two adults who just wanted a relaxing quiet time in Sharm so the HV was good for us, most of the complaints came from families with children.  I would say if your booked to go in 2008 then you will be laughing as it will be superb and the problems would have been ironed out but if your booked this year (2007) then think carefully about what you\u2019re after from your holiday.  Give the place bit more time to mature and I\u2019m sure it will be a real top 10 hotel in Sharm.\n", "summary": "Can only get better", "session_uuid": "1676d8b1-f640-4299-b202-d907b1c22542", "rating": 2, "context": {"item": "Coral Sea Holiday Village", "session_type": "TRUTH"}, "segments": [{"text": "The actual HV staff was very good and there were reps everywhere, they were all under massive amounts of pressure to get the place ready and keep people happy, as many people were complaining about various things, but the staff always said hello and always smiled.\n", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "NONE"], ["Staff", "POS"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}, {"text": "It was very quiet in there and had a lovely roof terrace with sofas and candle lit tables, inside was very contemporary and cool and the drinks were all served to your table by the bar staff, who were excellent.\n", "status": "C", "aspects": [["Amenities", "POS"], ["Staff", "POS"], ["Cleanliness", "NONE"]]}, {"text": "Much of the facilities where not open as promised, like the pirate ship for the kids and the beach bar, there was also no shop ready but makeshift stalls were laid out for things like cameras and batteries there was also a small selection of tack and some cigarettes but no multi-packs.

This is certainly not the case, it has in fact improved. The new block and gorgeous pool opened a couple of months ago but the hotel never seemed crowded.\n\nThe new restaurant opened just before our arrival and was much quieter and calmer than the main restaurant. We went there for breakfast but enjoyed the buzz of the Aladdin restaurant for our lunch & dinner. As somebody previously posted, the drinks service in the restaurant has reverted back to waiter service (it was help-yourself from the bar for a while). The service can be a bit slow but what's the hurry?!\n\nHow anybody can say the staff are rude and unfriendly is beyond me, the main reason we keep going back is the staff. I had a broken ankle on this trip and was looked after like a princess. I think the combination of being 2 females and regular visitors obviously helps, but the staff are so genuinely friendly. If you treat them with courtesy & a smile they will make your stay extra special. Every time we went for a meal a waiter rushed to carry my plate for me as I couldn't do it with my crutches. They don't expect tips but they are always gratefully received. Some of them will no longer take tips from us as they 'don't take money from friends', despite earning pittance.\n\nThe main pool area is great fun with the music, belly dancing lessons, aqua gym etc, but if you want peace and quiet just go to the pool by the new block which has all its own facilities but no music or entertainment.\n\nIf you are looking for a buzzing resort with loads of nightlife then don't go here, but if you want to relax and meet great people then this is the place for you. The evening entertainment has been stepped up a notch with a great band playing outside each evening (although I think this may havre been temporary) and an external dance troupe providing the International Show including spinning man & belly dancing. The in-house animation team put on a few shows which are also great fun.\n\nGo expecting Egyptian 5*, not Carribbean, as you are paying much lower rates than the Carribbean!

On returning from our day out, toppers had been added to the beds which did help with the softness, we had tissues, the bed still squeaked and if anything was worse, the curtins still did not close.

The room was relatively clean, but there were cob webs in the closet area, and mold on the shower tiles. It wasn't ideal, but the bed linens were crisp so I was okay with it.\n\nLater that night after we'd turned off the TV and my husband was asleep I was quietly reading with a small light and out of the corner of my eye I saw movement. A bat was circling above, the ceiling is vaulted so it was about 13-15 ft high. We both got up and went to the front desk to report the critter. They seemed un-alarmed and sent over someone to take care of it. It was at this same time as we started looking around the room that we noticed several large ants crawling on the floor and walls. We were disgusted, but had already paid for the room through Expedia and figured a different room wouldn't be much better.\n\nTwo days later I was getting ready in the room during the day, and am looking around (for bats) and sure enough I see a second one nearly camouflaged hanging on the side of the wood panel ceiling just a foot to the left of the head of the bed. The maid came in and took care of it, she was kind and apologetic, but again as before this didn't seem like it was out of the ordinary. We did not leave our windows open at any point, however they were open when we first arrived, so you can make your own guesses as to how the bats entered.\n\nThe final night of our stay I was having trouble sleeping (not too shocking considering) and both my husband agree that we heard something running around in the attic. It seemed kind of big, so it wasn't a bat. I have no clue.\n\nOther things to note:\nNo coffee pot in the rooms.\nThe pool is not heated so it's cold in the morning but heats up in the afternoon and isn't so bad. There isn't any music at the pool and the hotel in general was very quiet. At times it seemed like our family were the only people there.\nThe grounds are pretty, but it's remote, not much to do.\nThe staff was friendly.\nThe food was fine (nothing exciting, but not bad).

The entertainment team are being paid for next to nothing as hardly any body joins in the activities and nobody enjoys the shows they were the worst we have seen at any RIU hotel we have been to. The only show we enjoyed was diversity which was done by other people also in the 2 weeks we were there they only had a saxophonist once the rest of the time no music that's why everyone is bored and the only English channels on the TVs was cnn news or Fox News and a golf channel so no wonder it was so boring. The hotel is in a beautiful location which is its saving grace and looks beautiful and has lots of animals around including monkeys which we enjoyed the beach is lovely but not made the most of as its narrow due to the tide so not many can sit there as only a few trees for shade so it was a shame as it makes the pool area the only place to go. The food is good with plenty of choice but is all very bland so needed to put on Tabasco to liven it up! The staff are generally pretty good but when it came to having drinks bought round at the pool we only saw this being done 3 times in 2 weeks which to me seems very wrong as this is what you expect with 5 star. Overall it's reasonably priced and could be better to make it more appealing but we found lots of other people had the same thoughts as us we loved the country but didn't love the hotel.

An example - on arriving (very early after a long overnight flight) we found that out alloted room was ready but was not in front of the hotel - I asked to be moved and was prepared to pay any increase but was  advised that due to the upcoming cruise ship arrivals we would always during our stay have blocked views and the room we had be assigned was large and comfortable. I grudgingly agreed and was so glad I did - the staff were correct in that some of the largest cruise ships I have ever seen docked during our stay and our allocated room was wonderful so thanks to the staff for their honesty and care. The hotel is as I say in one of the best positions in Sydney with a roof pool that gives a panorama which is unbeatable. The breakfast even for vegans like us was excellent and offered a wide range of options - you have to try the juicer and see what combinations you can develop.
